# BDD-Javascipt

`bdd-javascript`  provides a starter kit for BDD testing your Javascript apps. 
We provide an simple opinionated setup by using [cucumber.js](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-js) 
to feature test your application.

## Writing Specifications
Place your *.feature* files inside the features folder and then run:
`**npm tests:**` to verify that they pass. I've added an example for you to start with.
